The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon bug that might occur when using the `:before` pseudo-element with content generated from a variable:

```css
:root {
  --my-content: "This is some content";
}

.my-element::before {
  content: var(--my-content);
}
```

This code seems harmless, but if `--my-content` contains special characters like quotes or backslashes that aren't properly escaped, it may lead to unexpected rendering behaviors or CSS parsing errors.  For example, if `--my-content` contains a single quote, it might prematurely terminate the content string.
